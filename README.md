# TRS

# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
	React Frontend with Django REST Framework (DRF) backend. 
	The two are connected by API calls using axios in the frontend. 
	The two frameworks are completely seperate from each other and 
	hence allows us to develop in parallel. Mobi1e app and web app 
	will both consume the same backend API. (React Native for mobile apps)
